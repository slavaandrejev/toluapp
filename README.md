# toluapp for Nightshade NG

Nightshade NG is simulation and visualization software for teaching and
exploring astronomy, Earth science, and related topics, developed by Digitalis
Education Solutions. This copy of toluapp holds a fork of tolua++ modified to
work with Nightshade NG. This being said, it will work with other software too,
it's just there is no goal to make it compile on Mac OS or Windows, for example.
